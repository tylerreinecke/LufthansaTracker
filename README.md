# LufthansaTracker

This app utilizes the Lufthansa API to track flights and airports operated by the Lufthansa airline.

With LufthansaTracker, you are greeted by a snazzy launch screen, and are then able to search for individual flights
by their number and date and add these flights to your favorites! Another option is to search for flights by each airport, 
displayed on a world map. Have fun tracking travels throughout the world! :)
